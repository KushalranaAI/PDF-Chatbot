# LLM-Powered PDF Information Retrieval

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable users to upload PDFs and ask questions related to the document's content.

## Description

This project allows users to interact with PDFs by uploading them and posing questions that the LLM will answer based on the document's text. The LLM's capabilities contribute to comprehension and informative responses.

## Technical Stack

* **FastAPI:** High-performance framework for building APIs in Python.
* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **LLM Integration:** Specific details depend on the chosen provider and their API.
* **Optional:**
    * **PDF Processing Library:** Library for handling PDFs (e.g., PyPDF2).
